# TexturePlayground-1
Some textures I grabbed from around the house on some shapes. Stuff to play with.

These need leveling to eliminate unsightly seams and I expect I'll learn more about what makes for a good texture as I play with things more.

I also want to add a wasd/mouselook navigation script to this thing so you can poke at these.

Also would be nice to drop a base in and support daydream with navmesh navigation.
