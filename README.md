# TexturePlayground-1
Some textures I grabbed from around the house on some shapes. Stuff to play with.

These need leveling to eliminate unsightly seams and I expect I'll learn more about what makes for a good texture as I play with things more.

I also want to add a wasd/mouselook navigation script to this thing so you can poke at these.

Also would be nice to drop a base in and support daydream with navmesh navigation.

Got this running on DayDream, Vive and flat monitor. It looks as if the scene doesn't get automatically loaded from a github pull so you may need to go looking for the scene with the skybox and texture demo shapes. I haven't checked in the Vive branch yet (each platform has a separate branch for now).

The textures are very clearly more visually interesting when rendered on the Vive than they are on the DayDream. I'll look again to see what the flat screen looks like.
